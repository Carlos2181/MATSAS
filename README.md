# MATSAS is a package of programs that analyse small angle scattering of neutrons and X-rays data obtained from porous systems. MATSAS has initially been developed for sedimentary rocks but can be used for other microstructures such as biological macromolecules, composite nanomaterials, or polymers. MATSAS is a script-based software that requires MATLAB® and spreadsheets (MS Excel or CSV) for manipulation and data processing. The software is freely available at GitHub (http://) with the programs and instruction included. Most of codes are described in green in the programs. The software instruction is composed of 6 chapters, which demonstrate the use of MATSAS. MATSAS is an open-source software, we welcome contributions from the SAS community, including comments, bug fixes, and source code contributions. Feedback can be sent to the GitHub’s forums or the MATSAS Development Team.
